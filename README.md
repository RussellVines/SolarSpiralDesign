<p>
This project was coded using the Python programming language. The project allowed me to demonstrate knowledge of the use of fuctions and how to call them into a program including the use of for loops and using the RGB spectrum to play with different colors and allowing the use of fading designs in digital art. This project has allowed me to hone on my knowledge of simple coding in Python.
